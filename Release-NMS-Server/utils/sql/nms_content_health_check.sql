-- ============================================================================
-- NMS content health check - verifies the DATA every custom-manifest version
-- (v18 through v25) is supposed to deliver, without trusting db_version.
--
-- Why this exists: we have now twice found servers whose custom_version was
-- stamped PAST an entry whose content never landed (a half-apply healed by a
-- later resync; a wholesale-skip healed by the v23-25 repairs). The version
-- number is a claim; this file is the audit. Every line prints its own
-- expectation - anything that misses its expected value identifies exactly
-- which payload is absent.
--
-- Run (akk-stack):
--   docker exec -i <mariadb-container> mariadb -u eqemu -p'<password>' peq \
--     < nms_content_health_check.sql
-- Or from any mysql/mariadb client: source nms_content_health_check.sql
--
-- READ-ONLY: SELECT/SHOW only. Safe on any server, any number of times.

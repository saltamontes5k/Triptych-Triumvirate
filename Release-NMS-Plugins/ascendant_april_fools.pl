# Bristlebane's Mischief - April Fools Event Plugin
# Adapted for Triptych/EQS: the master toggle now reads the local content flag
# 'april_fools' (same convention as erollisiday/frostfell). Enable/disable with
# the content_flags table (or GM tooling) and #reloadquests.
#
# Features:
#   1. Doppelganger (3%) - NPC clones attacker's appearance on combat engage
#   2. Size Pranks (~10%) - Player shrunk or enlarged on zone-in, reverts after 60-90s
#   3. Silly Death Emotes (4%) - Random funny zone emote on NPC death

# --- Master Toggle (content flag 'april_fools') ---
